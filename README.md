# React Component Library

This project skeleton was created to help people get started with creating their own React component library using:

- [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

It also features:

- :white_check_mark: [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to help you create and show off your components
- :white_check_mark: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) enabling testing of the components

[**Read my blog post about why and how I created this project skeleton â–¸**](https://blog.harveydelaney.com/creating-your-own-react-component-library/)

## Development

### Testing

```shell
npm run test
```

### Building

```shell
npm run build
```

### Storybook

```shell
npm run storybook
```

### Installing component library locally

Let's say you have another project (`test-app`) on your machine that you want to try installing the component library into without having to first publish the component library. In the `test-app` directory, you can run:

```shell
npm i --save ../react-component-library
```

which will install the local component library as a dependency in `test-app`. Your components can then be imported and used.

### Publishing

First make sure that you've updated the `name` field in `package.json` to reflect your NPM package name in your private or public NPM registry. Then run:

```shell
npm publish
```

## Component Usage

Let's say you created a public NPM package called `harvey-component-library` with the `TestComponent` component created in this repository.

Usage of the component (after the library installed as a dependency into another project) will be:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { TestComponent } from "harvey-component-library";

const App = () => (
  <div className="app-container">
    <h1>Hello I'm consuming the component library</h1>
    <TestComponent theme="primary" />
  </div>
);

export default App;
```

## Using internal SASS variables

I've found that it's helpful to export SASS variables to projects consuming the library. As such, I've added the `rollup-plugin-copy` NPM package and used it to copy the `typography.scss` and `variables.scss` into the `build` directory as part of the Rollup bundle process. This allows you to use these variables in your projects consuming the component library.

For example, let's say you installed `harvey-component-library` into your project. To use the exported variables/mixins, in a SASS file you would do the following:

```sass
@import '~harvey-component-library/build/typography';

.example-container {
    @include heading;

    color: $harvey-white;
}
```
